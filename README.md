# Senior Web Developer Roadmap – My Learning Journey

This repository documents my 2–3 year path toward becoming a Senior Web Developer.

## Goals

- Become strong in fundamentals (JS/TS, web platform)
- Grow into full system thinking (Frontend → Backend → Architecture)
- Be fully ready for roles in DE/AT/CH
- Build real project examples along the way
